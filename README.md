# PRO101 - Project
---
Schoolproject in the course PRO101 - Webproject. 

#### Assignment
We were tasked with creating a webpage, with the purpose of getting a focus on the community around the Campuses and what is being offered, ie. diners, coffe shops, fitness centers. Basicly whatever we wanted to focus on that highlighted the opportunities being offered for all the new students. Many of whom have just moved to Oslo and are new to the scene. 

Before we started on the coding of the project, we went through a small sprint as for how our group wanted to solve the assignment, deciding on a targetgroup, what we wanted our page to offer, choices regarding design and which technologies to use. 

#### Requirements
There were many technical and non-technical requirements. 
A general overview: 
- Techincal: 
  - Use multiple PHP-pages
  - Set up a database which we would need to communicate with through PHP.
  - Following a clean code principle, at least in general.
  - Use GitHub through our project. 
- Non-technical:
  - Use Kanban
  - Create an introductory video to the tool chosen to use with Kanban. <link>https://youtu.be/vbl8-kAJ3GU<link>
  - Create a prototype for the project
  - Document the targetgroup

#### Result
At the end of the project we had a webpage that was focused on a single part of the assignment. We chose to focus on events in the nearby community, with events that could be added by everyone, but that was to be managed by a small part of the community with an easy-to-use database management within the page itself for a non-technical user to be able to grasp. 

###### We used the following technologies: 
- PHP 
- JavaScript
   - jQuery
- HTML
- CSS
